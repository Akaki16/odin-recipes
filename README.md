# Odin Recipes

## Introduction

This project is part of The Odin Project course* (HTML section)

They taught us how to create HTML headings, paragraphs, links, lists, images and so on...

So after that they gave us the project to work on* called (odin-recipes)

This is a really good way to demonstrate our knowledge of HTML.
